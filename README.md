Malarial Cell Detection with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
Overview
This repository contains code for detecting malarial cells using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Malaria is a life-threatening disease caused by parasites that are transmitted to humans through the bites of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes. Early detection of malaria is crucial for timely treatment and prevention of its spread.

Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing the CNN model consists of images of blood smears containing both infected and uninfected red blood cells. The dataset can be obtained from drive link.

Requirements
Python 3.x
TensorFlow
Keras
OpenCV
NumPy
Matplotlib
Jupyter Notebook (optional for running the provided notebooks)
